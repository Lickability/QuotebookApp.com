This is your Includes folder.
===========================

If you're writing PHP, toss your includes files into this folder, then call them back out in your includes calls on your pages.

**This folder includes:**

1. header.php
2. footer.php

These two includes files carry the same content that you would find in the header and footer on index.html, but they're ready to be dropped into your php pages.

Cool? 

Cool.
