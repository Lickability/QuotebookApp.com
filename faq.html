		<h3>Where are all the quotes?</h3>
		<p>Quotebook is a notebook for your quotes. Just like a real notebook, it starts as a blank slate for you to fill with all of the quotes that matter to you. Just like the Notes or Contacts app, it would be disconcerting if it came filled with other people's information. We believe that quotes are personal and so is your Quotebook.</p>
		
		<h3>Is there an website / iPad app / Mac app in the works?</h3>
		<p>We don't like to comment in detail on future plans, but we can say we're excited about Quotebook's future on other platforms.</p>
		
		<h3>Why doesn't Quotebook sync quotes like <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/" title="Simplenote. An easy way to keep notes, lists, ideas, and more.">Simplenote</a> or <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox - Simplify your life">Dropbox</a>?</h3>
		<p>Syncing is a difficult problem to solve. We're working on it, but it takes time. <a href="http://twitter.com/quotebookapp" title="Twitter">Follow us on Twitter</a> to stay updated.</p>
		
		<h3>Do you have to type in all the quotes?</h3>
		<p>No, of course not. While typing in quotes is the primary way that people enter quotes into Quotebook, we also make it easy to enter quotes that you've copied to the clipboard with Auto-Detection and find quotes on the internet with Auto-Suggest.</p>
		
		<h3>What do you mean by "Quote Discovery"?</h3>
		<p>Quotebook makes it easy to discover new quotes from authors and sources. Any time you have typed in an author or source, just tap the blue arrow to the right of it. This will bring up information from Wikipedia. To view quotes from that author or source, if they are available, simply tap the "Quotes" button up top to load all quotes related to that subject from Wikiquote.</p>
		
		<h3>How does Auto-Detection Work?</h3>
		<p>Auto-Detection looks at your clipboard each time you open Quotebook and when you copy something from the built-in browser. If the item you copied appears to be a quotation, Quotebook will prompt you. If not, it'll leave you alone. If you'd like to disable Auto-Detection you can do so in Quotebook's settings.</p>
		
		<h3>How does Auto-Suggest work?</h3>
		<p>Auto-Suggest is a new feature of Quotebook that can help you remember quotes you know and discover new ones. As you start typing a quote, Auto-Suggest offers to complete the quote as well as suggest an author, source, and even tags. Quotebook relies on Freebase, so if Auto-Suggest doesn't find your quote, add it there and try again.</p>
		
		<h3>Can I have a promo code?</h3>
		<p>We love giving journalists and reviewers access to our application, but there are a limited number of promo codes per version. <a href="/#contact.html" title="Contact Us">Contact us</a> and we'll get back to you.</p>
		
		<h3>If you make Quotebook feed the world, I'll give you a 5 star rating.</h3>
		<p>First of all, that's not a question. Second of all, we add features to Quotebook based on a thorough design and development process. We love to hear your suggestions, but threats are not appreciated.</p>
