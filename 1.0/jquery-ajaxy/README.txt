Installation & Usage:
1. Refer to the (demo/index.html) or http://www.balupton.com/projects/jquery-ajaxy if the demo is not included.

Todo:
1. Need to add timeout for AjaxQueue. As in rare circumstances it just never pops out.

Options:
1. Refer to (scripts/resources/jquery.ajaxy.js) at about line 40 you will see the options with their information. 

Known Issues:
- Under Google Chrome, when in postpone or disable mode anchors may not scroll to the correct position when using back and forward buttons. [minor]
- Ajaxy form submit does not care for multiple submit buttons and only uses the last one. Issue due to jQuery's submit function. [minor]

Changelog:

v1.6.0-beta, August 31, 2010
- Added Ajaxy form demo.
- Added Ajaxy.onReady, Ajaxy.onDocumentReady and Ajaxy.onConfigured promises
- Controllers should now use classname instead of selector. B/C Break.
- $.fn.addAjaxy now supports passing a controller so we can add the Controller.classname to the element(s)
- Added $.fn.addAjaxy and $.fn.removeAjaxy
- State.actionCompleted callback now supports options.
- Added Refresh Action, this is triggered when we click the same Ajaxy link twice. If the refresh action does not exist a log will be outputted, and the Response action will be used instead. B/C Partial Break.
- Improvements to the anchor handling, page tracking and scrolling.
- While in postponed mode, and a anchor is clicked, we will treat the anchor as normal and not perform a redirect.

v1.5.1-beta, August 05, 2010
- Fixed a redirection issue

- Able to detect the severity of the page change, and if it is not considerable (such as only an anchor change) then do not both performing the request. 
- $.fn.SrollTo can now take the options argument. We also have a $.Ajaxy.options.scrollto_options for this.

- A few more options added, should refer to the documentation about these.

- Updated jQuery History dependencies to [v1.4.1-beta, August 05, 2010]

v1.5.0-beta, August 03, 2010
- Renamed format to extractHash. This change may break backwards compatibility in advanced cases.
- Added support for anchors. This now requires a call to [var Action = this; this.documentReady()] once the content has updated to inform Ajaxy that it can take care of anchors now. See the updated JavaScript in the demo for more information. To do this we have included Ariel Flesler's $.fn.scrollTo with Balupton's $.fn.ScrollTo extension.
- Added auto_ajaxify_documentReady option
- Added auto_sparkle_documentReady option
- Removed dependency on JSON2, instead we use jQuery's parseJSON
- Fixed track providing 3 slashes issue
- Fixed redirect issue
- History requirement is now bundled into built jQuery Ajaxy script, so no need to include both anymore. This saves space as History and Ajax share some dependencies.
- Updated jQuery History dependencies to [v1.4.0-beta, August 03, 2010]
- This release may be a final release if no bugs are found.

v1.4.0-beta, August 01, 2010

- Added #current to demo, to be similar to the jQuery History demo
- Fixed SEO in the demo by using [./] on the pages instead of [/]

- The Controller, State and Action are now separate entities. Instead of doing [this.response_data] or [this.data.response] you now do [this.State.Response.data]
- All references to Hash have been renamed to State appropriately
- We now support loading in complete HTML documents. Will find content and title automatically.
- Updated jQuery Sparkle dependencies to [v1.4.8-beta, August 01, 2010]
