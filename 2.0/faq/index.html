						<h3>General FAQ</h3>
						<h4 class="wherearequotes">Where are all the quotes?</h4>
						Quotebook is a notebook for your quotes. Just like a real notebook, it starts as a blank slate for you to fill with all of the quotes that matter to you. Just like the Notes or Contacts app, it would be disconcerting if it came filled with other people's information. We believe that quotes are personal and so is your Quotebook.
						
						<h4 class="isthereawebsite">Is there a Mac app in the works?</h4>
						We don't like to comment in detail on future plans, but we can say we're excited about Quotebook's future on other platforms.

						<h4 class="doyouhavetotype">Do you have to type in all the quotes?</h4>
						No, of course not. While typing in quotes is the primary way that people enter quotes into Quotebook, we also make it easy to enter quotes that you've copied to the clipboard with Auto-Detection and find quotes on the internet with Auto-Suggest.

						<h4 class="whatdoyoumean">How can I discover new quotes?</h4>
						Quotebook makes it easy to discover new quotes from authors and sources. Any time you have typed in an author or source, just tap the blue arrow to the right of it. This will bring up information from Wikipedia. To view quotes from that author or source, if they are available, simply tap the "Quotes" button up top to load all quotes related to that subject from Wikiquote.
						
						<h4 class="howdoesautodetect">How does Auto-Detection Work?</h4>
						Auto-Detection looks at your clipboard each time you open Quotebook and when you copy something from the built-in browser. If the item you copied appears to be a quotation, Quotebook will prompt you. If not, it'll leave you alone. If you'd like to disable Auto-Detection you can do so in Quotebook's settings.

						<h4 class="howdoesautosuggest">How does Auto-Suggest work?</h4>
						Auto-Suggest is a new feature of Quotebook that can help you remember quotes you know and discover new ones. As you start typing a quote, Auto-Suggest offers to complete the quote as well as suggest an author, source, and even tags. Quotebook relies on Freebase, so if Auto-Suggest doesn't find your quote, add it there and try again.

						<h4 class="canihaveapromo">Can I have a promo code?</h4>
						We love giving journalists and reviewers access to our application, but there are a limited number of promo codes per version. Contact us and we'll get back to you.

						<h4 class="ifyoumakequotebook">If you make Quotebook feed the world, I'll give you a 5 star rating.</h4>
						First of all, that's not a question. Second of all, we add features to Quotebook based on a thorough design and development process. We love to hear your suggestions, but threats are not appreciated.

						<h3>iCloud FAQ</h3>
						<h4 class="howdoigeticloud">How do I get iCloud</h4>
						First make sure you've upgraded to our latest version - any version before 2.0 does not support iCloud syncing. When you've installed this version, choose "Use iCloud" from the prompt at first startup. Once you've done this on all your iOS devices you're ready to go!
						<h4 class="doyouhaveaccess">Do you have access to my quotes?</h4>
						Quotebook neither accesses, sends, nor transmits any personal data. Syncing is handled entirely by iCloud, to which Apple has exclusive access. Your sensitive is data never collected for any reason, ever. We respect your privacy.
						<h4 class="enableicloud">How do I enable iCloud?</h4>
						Go to the settings in the app (by tapping the "gear" icon) and flip the iCloud switch from OFF to ON. Although it is technically supported, we recommend flipping this switch infrequently (hopefully only once, ever) for better iCloud performance.
						<h4 class="icloudoptions">Which iCloud option should I choose?</h4>
						We recommend you choose to stay on iCloud! The benefits are numerous and syncing will not work without the iCloud switch set to ON. If you really must disable iCloud, we recommend choosing to remove quotes from your device. This is the safest option should you choose to re-enable iCloud. Choosing to keep on your device can create duplicate quotes (although we take steps to prevent this, a few may slip by), but is also supported. Flipping the iCloud switch frequently is discouraged.
						<h4 class="onlinetosync">Do I need to be online to sync?</h4>
						If you add or modify quotes while offline, those changes will be applied as soon as that device comes online. So don't worry whether you're online or offline when adding quotes - they'll all be synced as soon as possible.
						<h4 class="syncingfaster">How can I make syncing faster?</h4>
						iCloud is sometimes instant, while at other times can take up to a few hours to sync to another device. Feel free to use all your devices and continue to add quotes in the meantime, as they will still be synced. There are special optimizations for devices on the same wifi network, so make sure both devices are connected to the same network for a possible (but not guaranteed) speed increase.
						<h4 class="notsyncing">My quotes aren't syncing!</h4>
						We're really sorry about that. If for any reason your quotes haven't been syncing for a while (a day or so), then feel free to send us an email (support@quotebookapp.com) and we'll make sure to get you syncing again using our patented iCloud Syncing Method (TM). We appreciate your patience, as iCloud is a new technology from Apple and we are working with them to make it a better service for everyone. We will work tirelessly to make sure you get the best experience possible, because nothing is more important to us.
