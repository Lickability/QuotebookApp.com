		<h4>New Features</h4>
		<ul> 
			<li><h5>Auto-Suggest</h5>
				<p>Try adding a famous quote to Quotebook. Can't remember the whole thing? Just use Auto-Suggest. Quotebook can now figure out the author, source, and even tags of famous quotations.</p>
				<p>Auto-Suggest isn't designed to search for new quotes. It uses the internet to complete quotes that you've come across or can't remember, saving you time and effort. Think of it as a tiny literary butler inside your iPhone.</p>
				<p>Try a few to get started: “Be the change…” “One small step…” “It's kind of fun…”</p>
			</li>
